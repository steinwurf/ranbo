Ranbo Documentation
===================

Ranbo is a C Random-Number-Generator library. We wanted to create a library that
allows us to use random-number-generators in both user-space and
linux-kernel-space that are fast and sufficiently random on a bit-level.

The Ranbo repository: https://github.com/steinwurf/ranbo

The ``examples`` folder contains some programs that demonstrate the usage
of the available API.

If you have any questions or suggestions about this library, please contact
us at our developer mailing list (hosted at Google Groups):
